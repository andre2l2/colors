# Collor Efect

![demo](./img/demo.gif)

I decided to create this repository for help you to understand some concepts in JavaScript, and CSS, that in my opinion are very importent and useful.

English is not my native language, so sorry for grammatical errors. But you can help-me?!

I have a idea of created this efect _collor_ that see in web site called [coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending). This web site have many collor palets, that I use on my projects, recommend it.

## Let's Started

Create a file html, css and javascript, do not fotget import the _JS_ and _CSS_ inside of html. In html we will create a teg div with __ID coolors__, where we will inject the colors

```html
  <body>
      <div id="coolors"></div>
  </body>
```
